#### 2.  Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Optional but recommended:

While I can use any text editor to work on this project, using an IDE can greatly improve my productivity. Popular choices for Spring Boot development include:
*  Eclipse
*  IntelliJ IDEA
*  Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.

I have used in this project the Eclipse IDE.  

#### 3. Build Tool - Maven or Gradle (Optional but recommended):

Spring Boot projects often use either Maven or Gradle as build tools. Choose one of the following options:
* Apache Maven
* Gradle

I have used Apache Maven
#### 4. Database System - Optional:

Depending on my project's requirements, you might need a database system installed locally. Common choices include:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* H2 Database Engine (for testing)

I have used H2 Database Engine

#### 5. Web Browser:

You'll need a web browser to test and interact with your Spring Boot web application.
### Installing

*   Java Development Kit (JDK)

## üîß Running the tests

To ensure the quality and stability of the Sevbazar system, automated tests have been implemented. Follow the steps below to run these tests on your local machine.

#### 1. End-to-End Tests
End-to-end (E2E) tests verify the system's behavior as a whole, simulating user interactions to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

To run the end-to-end tests, open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Then, execute the following Maven command:

mvn test -P e2e-tests

This command will trigger the execution of the end-to-end test suite, and the test results will be displayed in the terminal.

#### 2. Coding Style Tests
Coding style tests help maintain consistent code formatting and adherence to coding standards across the project.

To run the coding style tests, execute the following Maven command:

mvn test -P coding-style
The coding style tests will analyze the codebase for any violations of the defined coding standards.
